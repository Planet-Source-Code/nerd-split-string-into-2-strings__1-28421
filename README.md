## \_Split string into 2 strings\_


</div>

### Description

As a beginner my biggest problem ever was not being able to split a string and i didnt really learn how unil a while ago. splitting a string can be very useful for winsock and data storage type stuff. This works by putting a plus sign (+) between the two peices of data and splitting them based on that. Note: this uses a VB6 function so it will only work in VB6, also note that this code is in the begginer section so dont be a punk.  - nerd (www.nerdwareinc.com)
